* Transitions are great for simple animations
* Transitions control SPEED of the change when hovered/active
* Animation property is best for more complex animations
* Apply transition on the item you want to change
* With animations, we want to specify the animation on the CSS selector that triggers the animations
* Transitions require a trigger to run (hover, active, etc) but animations do not

* Animation fill mode forward will allow animation to stay at the end state
